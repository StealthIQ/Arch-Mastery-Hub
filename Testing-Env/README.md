### Automated Testing Environment Setup

This repository contains scripts to automate the setup of a testing environment, primarily for Maya projects on Ubuntu. The scripts install required packages and create configuration files for later use.

#### Usage:

**Using Wget:**

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StealthIQ/Arch-Mastery-Hub/master/Testing-Env/ubuntu.sh | bash
```

**Using Curl (for full Ubuntu installations):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StealthIQ/Arch-Mastery-Hub/master/Testing-Env/ubuntu.sh | bash
```

These scripts simplify and expedite the setup of your testing environment.
