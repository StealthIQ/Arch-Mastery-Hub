## How to Remove All Files from a Directory in Linux:

* **To delete all non-hidden files from a directory, type:**

````
$ rm -f /path/to/directory/*
````

* **To remove all files with the extension .txt from a directory, type:**

````
$ rm -f /path/to/directory/*.txt
````

* **To delete all non-hidden files and sub-directories along with all of their contents from a directory, run:**

````
$ rm -rf /path/to/directory/*
````

* **To delete all hidden files and directories from a folder, type:**

````
$ rm -rf /path/to/directory/{*,.*}
````

* **To delete all files from inside a folder but not remove its sub-directories, type:**

````
$ rm -f /path/to/directory/{*,.*}
````

* **To remove a folder whose name has a space, make sure to always use quotes like:**

````
$ rm -rf "directory name"
````

* **To see what is being done when deleting all files in a directory, pass the -v option to the rm command:**

````
$ rm -v /path/to/directory/*
````

* **To remove all the files from a directory having the extension .sh using the find command, you can use:**

````
$ find . -type f -name "*.sh" -exec rm -i {} \;
````

**Note**: In place of "*.sh," you can use "*" to delete all the files.
